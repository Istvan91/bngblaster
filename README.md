The BNG Blaster is an open-source network tester for access and routing protocols. 
It can simulate massive PPPoE and IPoE (DHCP) subscribers including IPTV, and L2TPv2. 

There are various routing protocols supported like ISIS and BGP. So you can use it for 
end-to-end BNG and non-BNG router testing. 

You can use the included traffic generator for forwarding verification, which allows you 
to test QoS configurations or measure convergence times. 

The traffic generator supports more than a million separate tracked flows. 
So you can use this to verify every single forwarding state of a full feed 
internet routing table. You can also send traffic for every single QoS queue 
of carrier grade BNG hardware. 

The BNG Blaster is used by network operators and vendors of network hard- and software.
