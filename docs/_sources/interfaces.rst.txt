Interfaces
==========

The BNG Blaster supports three types of interfaces. 

All interfaces are optional but obviously at least
one interface is required to start the BNG Blaster.

Interface Settings
------------------

The following settings are applied to all interfaces. 

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "interfaces": {
            "tx-interval": 0.1,
            "rx-interval": 0.1,
            "io-slots": 2048,
        }
    }


.. include:: configuration/interfaces.rst

The ``tx-interval`` and ``rx-interval`` should be set to at to at least ``1.0`` (1ms)
if more precise timestamps or high throughput is needed. This is recommended for IGMP 
join/leave or QoS delay measurements. For higher packet rates (>1g) it might be needed to
increase the ``io-slots`` from the default value of ``1024`` to ``2048`` or more.

The supported IO modes are listed with ``bngblaster -v`` but except
``packet_mmap_raw`` all other modes are currently considered as experimental. In
the default mode (``packet_mmap_raw``) all packets are received in a Packet MMAP
ring buffer and send directly trough RAW packet sockets.

The interfaces used in BNG Blaster do not need IP addresses configured in the host
operating system but they need to be in up state.

.. code-block:: none

    sudo ip link set dev <interface> up

It is not possible to send packets larger than the interface MTU which is 1500 per default
but for PPPoE with multiple VLAN headers this might be not enough for large packets.
Therefore the interface MTU should be increased using the following commands.

.. code-block:: none
    
    sudo ip link set mtu 9000 dev <interface>


This can be also archived via netplan using the following configuration for each BNG Blaster
interface.

.. code-block:: yaml

    network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        eth1:
        dhcp4: no
        dhcp6: no
        link-local: []
        mtu: 9000
        eth2:
        dhcp4: no
        dhcp6: no
        link-local: []
        mtu: 9000


.. note:: The number of interfaces is currently limited to 32!


Network Interfaces
------------------

.. _network-interface:

The network interfaces are used for traffic and routing protocols. 

Those interfaces can communicate with the configured gateway only.
Meaning that all traffic sent from the network interface will be sent 
to the learned MAC address of the configured gateway. 

The network interface behaves like a router. It accepts all traffic sent 
to its own MAC address. This allows to send and receive traffic for prefixes 
advertised via routing protocols or configured via static routes on the 
connected device under test.

The BNG Blaster responds to all ICMP echo requests sent to its own MAC address. 

.. include:: configuration/interfaces_network.rst

The BNG Blaster supports multiple network interfaces
as shown in the example below.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "interfaces": {
            "tx-interval": 1,
            "rx-interval": 1,
            "io-slots": 4096,
            "network": [
                {
                    "interface": "eth2",
                    "address": "10.0.0.1",
                    "gateway": "10.0.0.2",
                    "address-ipv6": "fc66:1337:7331::1",
                    "gateway-ipv6": "fc66:1337:7331::2"
                },
                {
                    "interface": "eth3",
                    "address": "10.0.1.1",
                    "gateway": "10.0.1.2",
                    "address-ipv6": "fc66:1337:7331:1::1",
                    "gateway-ipv6": "fc66:1337:7331:1::2"
                }
            ],
        }
    }

Using multiple network interfaces requires to select which network interface
to be used. If not explicitly configured one of the interface is selected 
automatically. Therefore, the configuration option ``network-interface`` 
is supported in different sections.

Access Interfaces
-----------------

.. _access-interface:

The access interfaces are used to emulate PPPoE and IPoE clients.

.. include:: configuration/interfaces_access.rst

For all modes, it is possible to configure between zero and three VLAN
tags on the access interface. The VLAN identifier ``0`` disables the
corresponding VLAN header. 

.. code-block:: none

    [ethernet][outer-vlan][inner-vlan][third-vlan][pppoe]...

            "outer-vlan-max": 0,

            "outer-vlan-max": 4049,

            "outer-vlan-max": 4049,
            "inner-vlan-min": 7,
            "inner-vlan-max": 7
        }
    }

Triple Tagged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: json

    {
        "access": {
            "interface": "eth1",
            "outer-vlan-min": 10,
            "outer-vlan-max": 20,
            "inner-vlan-min": 128,
            "inner-vlan-max": 4000,
            "third-vlan": 7
        }
    }

The BNG Blaster supports also multiple access interfaces
or VLAN ranges as shown in the example below.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "access": [
            {
                "interface": "eth1",
                "type": "pppoe",
                "username": "pta@rtbrick.com",
                "outer-vlan-min": 1000,
                "outer-vlan-max": 1999,
                "inner-vlan-min": 7,
                "inner-vlan-max": 7
            },
            {
                "interface": "eth1",
                "type": "pppoe",
                "username": "l2tp@rtbrick.com",
                "outer-vlan-min": 2000,
                "outer-vlan-max": 2999,
                "inner-vlan-min": 7,
                "inner-vlan-max": 7
            },
            {
                "interface": "eth3",
                "type": "pppoe",
                "username": "test@rtbrick.com",
                "outer-vlan-min": 128,
                "outer-vlan-max": 4000,
                "inner-vlan-min": 7,
                "inner-vlan-max": 7
            },
            {
                "interface": "eth4",
                "type": "ipoe",
                "outer-vlan-min": 8,
                "outer-vlan-max": 9,
                "address": "200.0.0.1",
                "address-iter": "0.0.0.4",
                "gateway": "200.0.0.2",
                "gateway-iter": "0.0.0.4"
            }
        ]
    }


The configuration attributes for username, agent-remote-id and agent-circuit-id
support also some variable substitution. The variable ``{session-global}`` will
be replaced with a number starting from 1 and incremented for every new session.
where as the variable ``{session}`` is incremented per interface section.

In VLAN mode ``N:1`` only one VLAN combination is supported per access interface section.
This means that only VLAN min or max is considered as VLAN identifier.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "access": [
            {
                "interface": "eth1",
                "type": "pppoe",
                "vlan-mode": "N:1",
                "username": "test@rtbrick.com",
                "outer-vlan-min": 7
            },
            {
                "interface": "eth2",
                "type": "pppoe",
                "vlan-mode": "N:1",
                "username": "test@rtbrick.com",
                "outer-vlan-min": 2000,
                "inner-vlan-min": 7,
            },
        ]
    }

A10NSP Interfaces
-----------------

.. _a10nsp-interface:

The A10NSP interface emulates an layer two provider interface. The term A10
refers to the end-to-end ADSL network reference model from TR-025.

The A10NSP interface is required for :ref:`L2BSA <l2bsa>` tests.  

.. include:: configuration/interfaces_a10nsp.rst

The BNG Blaster supports multiple A10NSP interfaces
as shown in the example below.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "interfaces": {
            "tx-interval": 1,
            "rx-interval": 1,
            "a10nsp": [
                {
                    "interface": "eth4",
                    "qinq": true,
                    "mac": "02:00:00:ff:ff:01"
                },
                {
                    "interface": "eth5",
                    "qinq": false,
                    "mac": "02:00:00:ff:ff:02"
                }
            ],
        }
    }

You can define multiple interfaces with the same MAC
address to emulate some static link aggregation (without LACP).
